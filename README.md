## ✨ Features

- **Secure Registration**: 
  - Each sneaker is registered with a unique identifier (serial number), ensuring that no duplicate entries exist. 
  - The registration process records the sneaker's details (name, model, and serial number) along with the current owner on the blockchain.

- **Ownership Verification**:
  - Users can verify the authenticity and ownership of sneakers by entering their unique serial numbers. 
  - The system provides detailed information about the registered sneaker, including its current owner.

- **Ownership Transfer**:
  - Facilitates the transfer of ownership from one user to another securely and transparently.
  - The process is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring traceability and eliminating disputes.

- **Decentralized and Immutable**:
  - The use of Ethereum ensures that all data is decentralized and immutable, providing trust and eliminating tampering.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Intuitive and responsive web application with clear instructions for registration, verification, and transfer.
  - Interactive components styled for ease of use and aesthetic appeal.

## 🔍 Key Functionalities

1. **Sneaker Registration**:
   - Enter sneaker details (name, model, and serial number) on the registration page.
   - The smart contract records the sneaker data along with the owner's blockchain address.

2. **Verification**:
   - Verify sneaker ownership by providing the serial number on the verification page.
   - Fetches and displays sneaker details, including ownership, from the blockchain.

3. **Ownership Transfer**:
   - Input the sneaker serial number and the recipient’s blockchain address on the transfer page.
   - The smart contract updates ownership details on the blockchain securely.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Immutable Records**: All registrations, verifications, and ownership transfers are permanently stored on the blockchain.
- **User Authentication**: Transactions are signed and verified through MetaMask, ensuring only authorized users can make changes.
- **Tamper-Proof**: Data cannot be altered once registered, providing a reliable and trustless environment.
